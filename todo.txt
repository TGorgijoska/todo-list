- use factories or constructors/classes to generate todo
- projects with separate lists of todos
- separate application logic from DOM-related stuff, separate modules
- use localStorage 
- https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns  library for manipulating dates and times

- The project should have:
    - view all projects
    - view all todos in each project 
    - expand a single todo to see/edit its details
    - delete a todo 

- Notes?  Checklist?
